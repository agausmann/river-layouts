# river-carousel-layout

Display the tail of the stack in a scrollable "carousel".

Inspired by [niri](https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri) and
[PaperWM](https://github.com/paperwm/PaperWM)

The basic structure is the same as stock rivertile. The main difference is that
the secondary area is scrollable and allowed to overflow outside the output. As
a consequence, the secondary windows do not have to be automatically resized
when another window is moved into or out of the secondary area.
